/* runtime/host/rt_atalk.h -- the instance-level C API of rt_atalk.inc
 * (2026-09-06 appletalk spec %6.1, Task 2), split into a header for the
 * ONE reason a header ever earns its place here: three translation units
 * need the same struct layouts. rt_atalk.inc defines them, and
 * rt_atalk_test.c plus tests/tools/atalkdrive.c both link against rt.c
 * and must agree byte-for-byte -- three hand-copied copies of
 * rt_at_req/rt_at_tuple would be a silent ABI bug waiting to happen.
 *
 * The rt_ext_AtalkH* Clarus-facing externs are deliberately NOT declared
 * here: they follow rt.h's own rule (see its header comment) that no
 * rt_ext_* symbol is ever centrally prototyped -- callers declare their
 * own extern. This header is only the rt_at_* instance API.
 *
 * Include AFTER rt.h (it needs int32_t/uint8_t, which rt.h pulls in).
