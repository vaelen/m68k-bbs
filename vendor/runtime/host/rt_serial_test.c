/* runtime/host/rt_serial_test.c -- hand-written C harness for the
 * `connection` type's host TCP glue (2026-08-15 serial-connection spec,
 * Task 4: runtime/host/rt_serial.inc, #included at the bottom of rt.c).
 * Mirrors rt_ser_test.c's style: CHECK macro, "OK\n" on success.
 *
 * Compile + run (mirrors sertest_c_test.go's own cc invocation --
 * internal/hostrt/serialtest_c_test.go wires this into `go test` the
 * same way, this line is just for anyone running it by hand):
 *   cc -std=c99 -Wall -Werror -I runtime/host \
 *      runtime/host/rt_serial_test.c runtime/host/rt.c -o /tmp/serialtest
 *   /tmp/serialtest
 *
 * Exercises rt_serial.inc purely through its public rt_ext_ConnH* API
 * (no prototypes for these live in rt.h -- see that file's own header
 * comment on why rt_ext_* symbols are never centrally declared -- so this
 * file declares its own extern prototypes below, exactly matching the
 * definitions rt_serial.inc supplies once linked in via rt.c).
 *
 * Two scenarios, each a full round trip against a real BSD peer socket
 * bound to 127.0.0.1 on an OS-chosen ephemeral port (no fixed port
 * numbers anywhere, so this never collides with anything else running):
 *   - listen mode  (slot 0, portIdx 0 / CLARUS_SERIAL_MODEM): the glue is
 *     the SERVER, a plain socket is the peer that connects in.
 *   - connect mode (slot 1, portIdx 1 / CLARUS_SERIAL_PRINTER): the glue
 *     is the CLIENT, a plain socket is the peer that accepts.
 * Both directions of 256 bytes of data are pushed through
 * ConnHWrite/ConnHAvail/ConnHReadByte in each scenario; the listen-mode
 * scenario additionally proves ConnHGone fires once the peer closes.
 *
 * A third scenario (slot 2, review fix round) proves the SIGPIPE fix:
 * write into a slot whose peer already closed its end, without ever
 * calling ConnHClose/observing Gone first -- exactly the state a real
 * open connection sits in between "peer hangs up" and "the next pump
 * pass's Gone check gets around to closing it". Before the fix, that
 * write's send() would raise SIGPIPE and kill the whole process with the
 * default disposition; the assertion IS the process still being alive to
 * check ConnHWrite's return value at all.

 * Root-caused this task (port-hygiene fix round, serial-connection Task
 * 7): the OLD version of this function retried "ConnHAvail (nudge the

 * exact behavior deliberately). That makes "ConnHWrite == 0" genuinely
 * AMBIGUOUS as a stop condition: it cannot tell "really sent to an
 * accepted peer" from "silently discarded because still listening", so
 * the old loop could -- and, confirmed by direct reproduction, DID --

 * historical "plain_recv_all failed" flake; adding more retries or a
 * longer read timeout, both tried first, cannot fix an ambiguous stop
 * condition -- the loop was never actually retrying past iteration 1).
 *
 * Fix: resolve the ambiguity with an independent, unambiguous signal
 * instead of trusting ConnHWrite's return code at all. peerFd (the SAME
 * already-connected peer socket the caller is about to read the real
 * payload back on) sends one throwaway sentinel byte first, in the
 * OPPOSITE direction (peer -> glue) from the real payload this function
 * writes (glue -> peer) -- full-duplex TCP, so this never touches what
 * the caller reads back. rt_ext_ConnHAvail's own FIONREAD path only ever
 * reports real queued bytes once accept() has actually happened
 * (rt_serial.inc's own doc comment: "0 whenever there's genuinely
 * nothing to read yet, including still listening"), so `wait_avail`
 * seeing that sentinel is unambiguous, definitive proof of acceptance --
